Welcome to this template-repo! `:)`
Goal of this repo is to provide a quick setup for rust-projects.

## Reason for `version < 1.0.0`

I hate all those projects staying with version `< 1.0.0` forever.
This section helps to remind everyone including myself, why I am not on version `1.0.0` yet, or whether I should already be above.


## Setup and usage

### Long story short

Rust has a build-tool called `cargo`, which can be used to run everything except scripts in `scripts/`.

```zsh
# Just executing some easy cargo-build-commands
./scripts/build.sh
# Execute the binary
./target/release/my_binary
```


## Credits
